## Claude PR Review Agent

This repository includes a small PR review agent for bounty [#4](../../issues/4). It fetches a GitHub pull request, inspects the diff metadata, and prints a structured Markdown review with the required sections:

- Summary
- Risks
- Suggestions
- Confidence score

### Setup

1. Install the GitHub CLI (`gh`) or set `GITHUB_TOKEN` for API access. If `gh` is not on `PATH`, set `GH_BIN=/path/to/gh`.
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x claude-review`.
3. Run it against a public PR:

```bash
./claude-review --pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

Optional file output:

```bash
./claude-review --pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 --output review.md
```

### Sample Outputs

Two sample reviews from real GitHub PRs are included:

- [`samples/review-1033.md`](samples/review-1033.md)
- [`samples/review-1356.md`](samples/review-1356.md)

### Verification

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
./claude-review --pr https://github.com/claude-builders-bounty/claude-builders-bounty/pull/1033 --output /tmp/review-1033.md
./claude-review --pr https://github.com/moleculerjs/moleculer/pull/1356 --output /tmp/review-1356.md
```
